# Team Project - Group 23 
# Analysis of variables in dataset using Linear Regression techniques

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the variables that predict the subscription
and purchase amount of the customers in the dataset.

The dataset selected by the team is from this [dataset link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/customer-shopping-trends-dataset?resource=download).


We chose the **Customer Shopping Preferences Dataset** because this
dataset encompasses various factors such as age, gender, purchase
history, preferred payment methods, and shopping frequencies, which are
fundamental for businesses aiming to tailor their strategies to customer
needs. Analyzing this data allowed us to gain practical experience in
applying data analysis and machine learning techniques to real-world
scenarios.

By utilizing various statistical techniques and regression analysis, we
tried to understand the relationships between customer demographics,
purchasing behaviors, and the methods of payment.

## Analysis Details

### Part A -- George Zuo

-   Verify if dataset has null values or other invalid data

-   Classify features to numeric and categorical group and encode categorical features

-   Use Logistic Regression to build a model

-   Split a dataset into training and testing sets using a random state

-   Fit model using train data and predict with test data

-   Check results by the Confusion Matrix and Accuracy Rate

### PART B -- Panpan Wang

Data Preprocessing:

-   Categorical Encoding: Transform the categorical variables (category and discount applied).

-   ColumnTransformer: Combining the one-hot encoding and passing through numerical features (age).

Model Building:

-   Pipeline Creation: Using pipeline to integrate the preprocessing step and the linear regression model.

-   Model Training: Fitting the pipeline to the data.

Model Evaluation:

-   Metrics: Calculating Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score to evaluate model performance.

-   Visualization: Creating a scatter plot to compare actual vs. predicted purchase amounts.

### Part C -- Pramod Sharma

-   Performed the following activities- preprocess data, run statistical tests, and perform regression analysis.

-   Specifically, I converted categorical data into numerical codes and clean the dataset by checking for and handling missing values. I also used statistical tests like Chi-square, T-tests, and ANOVA to analyze relationships and differences in our data.

-   As a part of the Regression Analysis I performed Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression to predict purchase amounts using independent variables of Age, Previous Purchases, Frequency of Purchases, and Payment Method.

### Part D -- Jingyi Lu

-   Clean data: load dataset/Convert categorical variables to numeric values/Bin the \'Age\' and \'Rating\' into groups

-   Define the X and Y

-   Split the data into training and testing sets

-   Train the Logistic Regression model

-   Evaluate model- get accuracy score, classification report and confusion matrix

## Key Findings

### Part A -- George Zuo

-   Accuracy: 83% indicates a high overall accuracy of the model.

-   Precision: For subscribers (1) is 63%, indicating that about 63% of the samples predicted as subscribers are actually subscribers.

-   Recall: For subscribers (1) is 94%, indicating that the model correctly identified about 94% of the actual subscribers.

-   F1-Score: 76% combines precision and recall, providing a balanced measure.

### Part B -- Panpan Wang

-   The model has a high Mean Squared Error: 559.9984322042955.

-   The model has a very low R² Score: 0.001525402943547749.

-   The scatter plot of actual vs. predicted purchase amounts indicates
    that the model\'s predictions are not well-aligned with the actual
    values.

### Part C -- Pramod Sharma

-   Chi-square Test: No significant association was found between Payment Method and Frequency of Purchases.

-   T-tests: No significant differences in purchase amounts were found between various payment methods.

-   ANOVA: Neither Payment Method nor Frequency of Purchases were significant predictors of purchase amounts.

-   Regression Analysis: All independent variables had p-values greater than 0.05, indicating that none were significant predictors of purchase amounts.

Detailed Regression Analysis Results:

-   Mean Squared Error (MSE): The MSE value of 559.12 is very high indicating the fit is not good.

-   R-squared (R²) Score: The R-squared score of -0.0034. Not good interpretation.

-   Coefficients and p-values: The coefficients for each variable (Age, Previous Purchases, Frequency of Purchases, Payment Method) indicate the estimated change in the purchase amount for a one-unit change in each predictor variable, holding other variables onstant. None of the coefficients are statistically significant at conventional levels (typically p \< 0.05).

-   F-statistic and Prob (F-statistic): The F-statistic with a value of 0.4399 and a probability (Prob (F-statistic)) of 0.780 indicates that the model as a whole is not statistically significant.

### Part D -- Jingyi Lu

-   The accuracy of the logistic regression model on the test set is
    approximately 44.79%.

-   The classification report and confusion matrix showed the model has
    high recall for Category 1 but fails to predict Categories 2, 3, and
    4.

## Conclusion

### Part A -- George Zuo

The model performs well with an accuracy of 83%. We may use it as a tool
for predicting customer subscription behavior, and then develop
corresponding marketing strategies for different customer groups.

### Part B -- Panpan Wang

The result concludes that the linear regression model does not
accurately capture the relationship between the independent variables
(Age, Category, Discount Applied) and the dependent variable (Purchase
Amount (USD)). The high MSE and low R² score suggest that the model\'s
performance is poor and it fails to explain the variance in the purchase
amounts. This indicates that the chosen features and model may not be
appropriate for predicting purchase amounts.

### Part C -- Pramod Sharma

The regression analysis suggests that the variables Age, Previous
Purchases, Frequency of Purchases, and Payment Method do not
significantly predict Purchase Amounts in this dataset.

### Part D -- Jingyi Lu

The logistic regression in this case is in poor performance. Even though
the overall accuracy is approximately 44.79%, it only performed very
well in predicting Category 1, not Categories 2, 3 and 4.
